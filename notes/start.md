Yup, with the public folder, expect a full backend. Fn, I'm frontending this bii

# Log 00002 -31082021 : Inspiration to split

- I've obtained my primary color, the blue in the wave svg.
  I'll flip it to close the site off at the bottom in the footer

- The dropcap will be done with two p tags , allowing for a good segue in to the image and it's links and then finally the github links, then more text!
  In portrait mode, it'll blend right in.

- A bit indecisive with that background... blue? or brown?

- The splitting is for portability,
  I'll style my general layout normally, then add the content for about then add interactivity with react

- Also, for the headers, I believe only h1 will be significantly bigger in terms of weight.
  Everyone else will look like my google docs headers (speaking of, should I port that? Maybe. Polly after)
  Everyone else will only vary in terms of size.
  Then I have to think about containers for my headers.
  Or at least a way of containerising them with CSS for beautiful effects and what not
