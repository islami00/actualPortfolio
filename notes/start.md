Yup, with the public folder, expect a full backend. Fn, I'm frontending this bii

# Log 00002 -31082021 : Inspiration to split

- I've obtained my primary color, the blue in the wave svg.
  I'll flip it to close the site off at the bottom in the footer

- The dropcap will be done with two p tags , allowing for a good segue in to the image and it's links and then finally the github links, then more text!
  In portrait mode, it'll blend right in.

- A bit indecisive with that background... blue? or brown?

- The splitting is for portability,
  I'll style my general layout normally, then add the content for about then add interactivity with react

- Also, for the headers, I believe only h1 will be significantly bigger in terms of weight.
  Everyone else will look like my google docs headers (speaking of, should I port that? Maybe. Polly after)
  Everyone else will only vary in terms of size.
  Then I have to think about containers for my headers.
  Or at least a way of containerising them with CSS for beautiful effects and what not

- A side note: here is the google import for css for fonts if you want to switch

```CSS
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100&display=swap');
```

- Looking at wes's page, I like the flow of things.
  He used flex for the general wrapping of the page as a column, I copied it too.
  The menu could get mushed up, so he made it a grid, Love it!
- Plus, it's ok to use divs for things like wrapping , screen readers won't look at it, they **igore** it
- Some thoughts on accessibility.
